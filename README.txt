NOTE: The file to be reversed must be present in the same directory and also the second argument must be relative path of the file ONLY!
Features used:
write, mkdir, strcpy, strcat, creat(to create a new file), open(to open files), lseek, chdir, stat(to check file permissions),if and else conditions to give logic to the code.
Firstly make sure that there is no folder named "Assignment", otherwise there will be an error.
Steps:
compile 1.c (gcc 1.c)
run ./a.out <filename> (./a.out <file>) eg: ./a.out input (and not ./a.out ./input)
compile 2.c (gcc 2.c)
run ./a.out <filename> (./a.out <file>) eg: ./a.out input (and not ./a.out ./input)
Done!
Thank you!
